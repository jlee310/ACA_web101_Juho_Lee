                                My name is Juho [joo-ho], and I am currently an MFA Products of Design student at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. I am trying to find the best solution for peopleâ€™s difficulties within a broad range of design fields including UX/UI, product, and interaction design. 

                                Apart from design, I love to paint, draw, and sketch. Most of all, I love to capture stunning moments of my life with my 35mm lens camera. Feel free to reach out for any inquiries or just to say hello via
